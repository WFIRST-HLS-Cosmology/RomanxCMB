explanation: |
        "This simple module calculates the linear growth factor D, and linear growth rate, f, for flat cosmology with either const w or variable DE eos w(a) = w + (1-a)*wa
        for modified gravity models with mu(a) = 1 + mu0 * Omega_DE(a) where mu0 is a constant, and one recovrs GR for mu(a) = 1. 
        Where D, f are defined by the growth of a
        linear perturbation, delta, with scale factor a: delta(a') = delta(a)*(D(a')/D(a)) and f = dlnD/dlna"
