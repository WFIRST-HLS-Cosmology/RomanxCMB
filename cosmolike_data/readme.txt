Note: the cosmolike data is not included in the git repo. Download it from the provided drive link and add it to this folder. Only the non-gaussian contributions are provided for download.

File name conventions as follows:

covariances_WFIRST_SO_gold_ng_zgauss_v2 full covariance for optimistic case, cov from Cyrille
_ng is only the non gaussian part
_g is only the gaussian part

covariances_WFIRST_SO_gold_ng_zgauss_pessim full covariance for conservative case, cov from Cyrille
_ng is only the non gaussian part
_g is only the gaussian part

covariances_WFIRST_SO_gold_ng_zgauss_wide.npy full covariance for wide scenario, cov from Cyrille
_ng is only the non gaussian part
_g is only the gaussian part
