This folder provides an example of our parameter inference. To run the code the the 3 scripts in the folder need to be executed. First the fisher forecast, then the bayesfast code and finally the importance sampling step.

This requires significant computational resources and is not plug and play. We provide the example to serve as a guide to implement this approach on other super computers.
