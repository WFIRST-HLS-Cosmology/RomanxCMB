version: 2
purpose: Calculate per bin number density n(z) based on overall redshift distribution

assumptions:
    - "n(z) file first column = z, others = bin n(z)"

explanation: |
    "This module just loads the overall distribution of observed galaxies
    Then it splits them in the requested number of eually sized bins
    and then convolves with a redshift weighted gaussian.
    The gaussian is: $$n^i_x(z_{\mathrm{ph}}) = 
    \int_{z^i_{\mathrm{min},x}}^{z^i_{\mathrm{max},x}} dz \, n_{\mathrm{x}}(z) \, 
    p^i\left(z_{\mathrm{ph}}|z,x\right)\,, $$
    with $$p^i\left(z_{\mathrm{ph}}|z,x\right) = 
    \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma_{z,x}(1+z)} 
    \exp\left[-\frac{\left(z-z_{\mathrm{ph}} - \Delta^i_{z,x}\right)^2}{2\left(\sigma_{z,x}(1+z)\right)^2}\right]\,.$$
    The n(z) are normalized before being saved. You can marginalize over the sigma and addidive bias.
    This module is based on version 1 of load_nz in the standard cosmosis library."

# List of parameters that can go in the params.ini file in the section for this module    
params:
    filepath: "String; absolute or relative path to overall n(z) file"
    nbin: "Integer; number of equally sized bins to split the distribution into"
    z_min: "Real; low cutoff applied to the overall distribution"
    z_max: "Real; high cutoff applied to the overall distribution"
    nsamples: "Integer; Number of samples in redshift from 0 to zmax"
    input_section: "String, optional; If set, look for input parameters in this named section instead of wl_photoz_errors. If not set but sample is set, look in sample_errors"
    output_section: "String, default ''wl_number_density''. The section to which to save the output."
#Inputs for a given choice of a parameter, from the values.ini or from other modules
#If no such choices, just do one of these omitting mode=something part:
inputs: 
    wl_photoz_errors:
        bias_i: Real; for i=1..nbin. Bias size for this bin, also called Delta_i.
        sigma_i: Real; for i=1..nbin. Sigma size for this bin.

outputs:
    output_section:
        nz: "Integer; number of redshift samples. By default all these will go in wl_number_density."
        nbin: "Integer; number of bins"
        z: "Real vector; redshift sample values"
        bin_: "Real vector; n(z) at redshift sample values.  bin_1, bin_2, ..."
